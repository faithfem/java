// Boolean Operators: &&, ||, and ! are used to build Boolean expressions and have a defined order of operations
// Statements: if, if/else, and if/else if/else statements are used to conditionally execute blocks of code
// Ternary Conditional: a shortened version of an if/else statement that returns a value based on the value of a Boolean expression
// Switch: allows us to check equality of a variable or expression with a value that does not need to be a Boolean
